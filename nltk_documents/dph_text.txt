Sanne
“It is easy to tell that The Danish Pastry House is so much more than “just a bakery” – it is a place the staff really care about, – this shines through in the vibe at your place, as well as in your products. Very unique!”

Søren Olsen

“I just wanted to let you know that, as a Dane, I was so excited to see that there is a Danish bakery fairly close to where I live. I bought fastelavnsboller and spandauer, and it was so good – tasted exactly like it should, and I was even able to read Billed Bladet in your café.

Rest assured that I will be visiting you again and again during my last year here in the US. I will also make sure to tell my colleagues here about your bakery and café, so that they can get a taste of what a real Danish is.”

“Thank you again for providing such a generous sampling of your pastries. My sister and I are so impressed with them that we’ve decided to purchase our pastries and desserts from The Danish Pastry House exclusively.
We’re excited to work with you and to offer such delicious fare to our customers.”


IT’S FAMOUS

HYGGE - (N.) THE DANISH CONCEPT OF WARMTH, CONNECTION, AND WELL-BEING IN A COZY ATMOSPHERE
Reading by the fire. Coffee with friends. A home-cooked meal. All of these capture the essence of hygge. Pronounced 'hue-gah', this Danish concept is not meant to be translated, but felt. Hygge is about living in the moment, connecting with our friends and family, and allowing ourselves time to slow down and enjoy life. We can create these moments with a few simple ingredients: comfy pillows, good food, candlelight, and - most importantly - good people.
